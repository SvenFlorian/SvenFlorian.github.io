This is my try at a personal page/blog using an existing bootstrap theme from [BlackTie.co](http://www.blacktie.co/). This is basically a Jekyll port of the theme, which is licensed under the same terms as the original work; [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). This means you can:
 *  Use it for personal stuff
 *  Use it for commercial stuff
 *  Change it however you like

All for free. In exchange, just give BlackTie.co credit for the design.


For further development, please see [Stanley-Jekyll](https://github.com/SvenFlorian/Stanley-Jekyll).
